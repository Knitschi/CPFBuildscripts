CPFBuildscripts
===============

The CPFBuildscripts package-component provides python scripts for simplifying the CMake calls of CPF projects.
The scripts can be used for configuring and building a CPFCMake project.
CMake projects usually require calls to CMake to generate makefiles and build the project. Depending on
the project, the calls can require quite a list of arguments. The python scripts provided by the
CPFBuildscripts package-component use the knowledge about the structure of the CPF project to reduce the length
of those commands. It is therefore highly recommended to use the CPFBuildscripts package-component in combination
with the CPFCMake package.
